### Data Science miniproject (IDS 2021).

### About the project

If you have wathced movies in the 21st century or searched movie recommendations from the web in the recent past you've probably at least heard of **IMDB** and **Rotten Tomatoes**. 

These sites have very widely acknowledged rating systems and thus many people rely on them when searching new films to add to their watchlists.

These sites serve also as great source of data about movies and their reception among audiences. Our goal is to use this data to train a **Machine Learning model** which predicts the rating of a movie based on the description of movie idea. If this sounds like a service you have been missing for the past 10 years then look no further!
